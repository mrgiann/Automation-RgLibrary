# Automation-RgLibrary

Python script that automates the collection of video game media and information. It downloads images (gameplay and logos), extracts descriptions and system requirements from reliable sources like Vandal and Play Support, and organizes everything into folders for each game. Ideal for projects that need to store this type of data, it's the one I use for rglibrary.
